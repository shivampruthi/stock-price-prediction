# Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a basic stock price prediction model using Linear Regression, a simple machine learning algorithm. It's a useful starting point for understanding how linear regression can be applied to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Generation**: We start by generating synthetic stock price data to simulate a scenario where stock prices generally increase over time. This serves as a simplified representation for learning purposes.

2. **Data Preparation**: We split the generated data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train our Linear Regression model, while the testing set is used to validate the model's accuracy.

3. **Model Training**: We create a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn. The model 'learns' the relationship between the number of days and stock prices from the training data.

4. **Prediction**: Using the trained model, we make predictions for stock prices on the test data.

5. **Visualization**: We visualize the actual stock prices and the predicted stock prices using Matplotlib.

## How to Use

You can use this project as a learning resource for understanding the basics of Linear Regression and how it can be applied to stock price prediction. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with real-world data for more accurate predictions.

To run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib) installed.
3. Run the provided Python script.
